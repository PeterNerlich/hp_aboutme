			<p>Welcome, I am <b id="myname">Peter Nerlich</b>, still a high school student from Germany, but soon I will graduate. I'm going to study computer science. I am already some years into programming, I know <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and of the <q>real</q> programming languages <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>Python</b> and <b>Bash</b>. I also fiddle with less known languages like <b>Ti-Basic</b>, or rather <b>Axe parser</b>, a sort-of assembler near language on my Ti-84 Plus, because it is so much faster.<br>
			I'm in love with <b>Linux</b>, my current distro is Ubuntu. I can highly recommend the <b><a href="https://frontend.buzz/" target="_blank">Frontend BUZZ</a></b> newsletter along with the other work of my fellow pupil <a href="https://anselmurban.de/" target="_blank">Anselm Urban</a>.</p>
			<p>Below you find the different platforms I have an account on. If you like what I do there, let me know.</p>

		<p>Since I was about ten I was interested in programming - At first I begged my dad to show me how to make a website. Soon I knew the most basic things in <b>HTML</b> by heart and some basics of <b>CSS</b>. He didn't always have the time to coach me, so I got used to looking things up on my own. When I got a sub domain on my dad's webserver I learned <b>PHP</b> as well as my first <i>real</i> programming language, because he introduced my to the <a href="http://websitebaker.org/" target="_blank">WebsiteBaker</a> CMS. I didn't notice when I exceeded my fathers knowledge, but then there were a few times when another idea stroke my mind what I wanted to do and I asked him, because I was away from the computer, and he sighed overwhelmed and said something like: <q>Well I don't know. Don't expect me to know specific stuff like that. I doubt I would find it if I went to look.</q><br>
		After I realized that felt more and more limited in what I could do in this environment I someday got interested in <b>JavaScript</b>. I was confused at first and quickly gave up on trying. But then, when I was obsessed with <q>making games</q> and got to know <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity3D</a>, I watched a lot of tutorials and learned JavaScript this way. I also learned <b>English</b> there a lot, I would say that only 10% (on the other hand also including the most important first steps) of my ability to understand and speak English are because of school. So after my wannabe-game-making phase I got back to doing websites and boy was it helpful that I learned JavaScript.<br>
		Then I once had a bad crash that corrupted my system and I went from Windows to <b>Linux</b>, more precisely, <a href="http://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>. Guess what. I thought I arrived in heaven. What at first was only thought to help me recover the most important data became my main system. The idea of free, continously updated software you could easily modify yourself simply blew my mind. Yes, there were problems, but you could <i>actually resolve them</i>! Watching the software solutions dialog do nothing and reboot wasn't the only options you had. I leaned to love the console/terminal and <b>Bash</b>. Anything was possible. Soon after I got two <a href="https://raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>, set up the former <a href="http://kodi.tv" target="_blank">XBMC (now Kodi)</a> as a mediacenter for our family and thus came to learn a little <b>Python</b> in an attempt to write my own plugins.<br>
		Later I got to know <b>NodeJS</b>. Freely programming your server and all the advantages and possibilities that come with it really got me exited. I am no big programmer of web services there yet, but I made some local services that e.g. automatically download the next 10 episodes from my anime hoster of choice in times of slow internet. I'm currently looking into meteor and telescope a bit and supporting my fellow pupil <b><a href="https://anselmurban.de/" target="_blank">Anselm Urban</a></b> with his promising and well received project <b><a href="https://frontend.buzz/" target="_blank">Frontend BUZZ</a></b> a bit, but school is mostly stalling all my efforts now. I hope to be kick-starting myself again once my <b>A-Levels</b> are done.</p>
